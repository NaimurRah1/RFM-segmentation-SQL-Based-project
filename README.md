## 📌 What is RFM Segmentation?
RFM Segmentation is a business analysis technique used to evaluate and classify customers based on their purchasing behavior.  
Customers are analyzed and grouped into different segments according to three key factors:

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made their last purchase.  
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes purchases within a given time period.  
- **Monetary (M):** How much money a customer spends in total.

## Project Description
Analyze customers using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** metrics to guide business decisions:  

- **Champions** → reward & retain  
- **Loyal** → maintain engagement  
- **Potential Loyalists** → encourage more purchases  
- **Promising** → boost frequency  
- **Needs Attention** → re-engage  
- **About to Sleep** → win-back campaigns  

This project uses **SQL** to segment customers and support strategic decision-making.
